                This app demonstrate how to create a new angular app from scratch. The
                main requirement is: Create an input form using Material to insert
                multiple “friends” with the following fields:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>Weight</li>
                <li>Friends</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Acceptance conditions are as follows (ACs):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the current version of Angular</li>
                <li>Be production ready</li>
                <li>Use Angular Material</li>
                <li>Use NgRx for state management</li>
                <li>Display results using D3.Js library</li>
                <li>Make your components stateless</li>
                <li>Use of git and organization of commits</li>
                <li>
                    Provide unit test coverage (testing actions, reducers, selectors and
                    pipes)
                </li>
                <li>The code should be stable, maintainable, and bug free.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Due to time constraints a minimum viable product (MVP) version that
                meets the requirements was created. It showcases different technologies
                and features of the Angular framework. The following are pending tasks
                that could help further increase the quality of this demo:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Security:</b>&nbsp;Secure the route access using guards and
                    integrate with an identity system or security code from the back-end
                    to control authentication and authorization.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Localization:</b>&nbsp;Provide translation of the UI to different
                    languages/region. Support international formats where required.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Responsiveness:</b>&nbsp;The responsiveness of the app needs more
                    work
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Test coverage:</b>&nbsp;Since this is a demo app only basic
                    coverage is provided. In a truly production ready a higher level is
                    desired Different automated tests to implement can be: unit,
                    component, DOM and e2E tests. Performance testing is also advisable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Improvements to the graphics:</b>&nbsp;Simple bar charts are
                    provided. More complex one would be required for an actual app. The
                    graphics would need to be responsive and interactive whenever
                    possible, updating them by transitions instead of by refreshes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Additional code refactor:</b>&nbsp;Improve the existing code by
                    creating new components to extract reusable code, reduce the size of
                    the larger classes, and moving common files to shared
                    folders/components. Style files could use some cleaning to reuse
                    common styles used in different components.
