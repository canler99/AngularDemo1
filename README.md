# Friends demo App

This app demonstrates how to create a new angular app from scratch.

![material-starter-ux2](https://github.com/canler99/AngularDemo1/blob/main/src/assets/FriendsApp.png?raw=true)

Above is a snapshot of the UI with a **List-Detail** layout: showing a list of friends
(left) and a friend detail view (right). On the right panel the add/edit views are also displayed.

## Goals

The main goal is to implement an input form using Material to insert multiple “friends” with the following fields:

- Name
- Age
- Weight
- Friends

## Instalation on a local environment

###### Prerequisites

- NodeJS LTS version
- Npm v8.x

###### Getting Started

Clone this repository and execute the following commands in a terminal:

* `git checkout master`
* `npm install`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag
for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
